#   Real-time recognition of phrases and words expressed in sign language 
This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing sign language gestures in real-time. It will use a dataset of labeled videos containing 20 different sign language gestures from the BSL20 and BL63 Data sets, as well as a custom dataset with 20 pre-determined labels. To extract relevant features from the video frames, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) will be used. Image processing techniques such as filtering, edge detection, and other relevant methods will also be used. A classifier will be trained using a supervised learning approach and evaluated through experiments and testing in live environments. The model will improve communication between deaf and hearing individuals, representing a significant step towards inclusion and accessibility for the deaf community.

## Visión Artificial---Project
Development of code using neural networks (CNN) in order to recognize sign language, classify it and display the results. 

## Motivation
The project has its origin due to the multiple uses that can be applied in artificial vision currently in various aspects, especially in order to support people. It is for this reason that this project aims to be able to generate a more inclusive society, through the recognition, classification and display of the results of a sign through artificial vision, deep learning and the use of neural networks (CNN).

## Tecnologies/Frameworks used
- Google Colab

## Most important functionalities
Among the main functionalities that the project fulfills, they are mainly based on the generation of its own dataset and filtering for the training of the model, in turn that the model is capable of receiving the videos and in this way analyze them, process them and through networks. (CNN) train, validate and test them, thus preparing for the input of an external signal to check its efficiency.
